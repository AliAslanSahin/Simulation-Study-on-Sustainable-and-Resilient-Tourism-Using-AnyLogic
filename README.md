Sustainable and Resilient Tourism Simulation

This repository is dedicated to my academic project focused on Sustainable and Resilient Tourism Simulation. The aim of this project is to develop simulations that help understand and improve the resilience of the tourism industry in the face of challenges like natural disasters, economic crises, and other systemic pressures.

Project Overview:

The project uses AnyLogic simulation software to model and simulate the dynamics of the tourism sector, with an emphasis on sustainability and resilience. The goal is to identify vulnerabilities in the tourism industry and find ways to minimize the risks, improve recovery strategies, and contribute to more sustainable tourism practices.

Key Features:
	•	Sustainable Tourism Models: Simulating how tourism can be more sustainable in the long term.
	•	Resilience Analysis: Identifying the factors that affect the resilience of the tourism sector, such as natural disasters, economic changes, and political factors.
	•	Systemic Dynamics: Modeling complex relationships and interactions within the tourism industry, including stakeholders, policies, and external factors.

Tools Used:
	•	AnyLogic: Simulation software used for modeling dynamic systems and running simulations.
	•	Research Data: The project will rely on data collected from various sources to calibrate the models and ensure realistic simulations.

Academic Context:

This project is part of my studies in Tourism Business Administration at Boğaziçi University. It is intended to explore how simulation and system dynamics can be applied to improve the tourism sector’s resilience to various pressures.

Repository Contents:
	•	Simulation Models: Files related to AnyLogic simulations of sustainable and resilient tourism.
	•	Documentation: Detailed explanation of the model setup, methodology, and data sources.
